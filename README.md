## Getting Started

This project is a multiplayer card game where players take turns attacking each other's health points while managing their guards. The game is played in a web browser.

## Game Rules
The game is played with multiple players, each starting with a set of cards representing health points and guards.

Players take turns attacking each other by drawing a card from the deck.

The goal is to reduce opponents' health points to zero.

Players can also manage their guards to defend against attacks.
